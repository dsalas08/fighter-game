ðŸ¥‹ Fighter Game

A turn-based battle simulator written in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

ðŸŽ® How It Works
You create your own custom fighter and the computer randomly selects an opponent.
Each fighter starts with 100 HP.
On your turn, choose to:
roll â†’ deal 10â€“20 damage
risk â†’ either deal 30â€“40 damage OR take 15â€“25 damage yourself
The opponent takes turns with the same logic.
First fighter to reach 0 HP loses. You can play rematches infinitely.
